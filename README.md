# Get-to-Know-Me
  I'm Fiona Corr, a journalism and design student at Lehigh University. I'm currently taking Visual Communication and Data Journalism (for which I'm creating this GitHub page), and I'm a lifestyle reporter for The Brown & White. I'm also going to be working as a columnist, where I'll write about trends among college students and their implications. 
  I'm from right outside Philadelphia, specifically Newtown Square. I live there with my parents and my dog, Cian. He's a blue staffy and has replaced me as the baby of the family. I have an older brother and sister, Jude and Seanna, who live across the country in Florida and Wisconsin. I like to return home whenever possible and love when all six of us can be together. 
  In my free time I like to paint and draw, specifically portraits, and write fiction. However, on my more active days, I like to ride horses and go kayaking with my family. Also, like most people, I love to watch movies and listen to music. My personal favorites are Kill Bill for movies and Frank Ocean for music!
